Hi, I am **Karan Nagpal**! I am working as a Senior Software Developer at [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/).

![Profile Picture](/img/about/profile-picture.jpg)

Though I don't really love to write, there are few things which when you learn, you want others to learn as well. Maybe because they are interesting or maybe there wasn't enough documentation when you learnt it and spent a lot of time figuring out how stuff works. Hence this blog was formed. I believe knowledge is best shared.

Also programming is all about productivity so let's help other become more productive and solve real problems :)

I also love travelling and capturing things into my lens which catch my eye. For that you can follow me on Instagram (link below) for now until I write about my travel expiences in another blog.

I'm currently living in Mumbai, Maharashta, India.

Now that you know so much about me, you should say hi!
